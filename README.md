TRE Escape Room Controller

You are probably best to download the .zip file from the GitHub repo and extract the contents and copy the EscapeRoomGames directory to somewhere on your hard drive.

Try to use the installer in the installer directory.

Currently, the installer doesn't add an icon to the desktop or programs menu. Look for the application .exe in the

   ..\Program Files (x86)\Twisted Room Escapes\Escape Room Controller directory

Change the EscapeRoomController.exe.config file in the application installation directory to point to the location of the EscapeRoomGames.

See the Escape Room Controller.docx file for detailed information.
