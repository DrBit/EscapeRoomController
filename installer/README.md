TRE Escape Room Controller Installer

See the Escape Room Controller.docx file for detailed information.

Currently the installer doesn't add an icon to the desktop or programs menu. Look for the installed .exe in the 

   ..\Program Files (x86)\Twisted Room Escapes\Escape Room Controller directory

Download the EscapeRoomGames directory and contents. Locate somewhere on your hard drive or network. 

You are probably best to download the .zip file from GitHub and extract the contents and copy the EscapeRoomGames directory to somewhere on your hard drive.

Change the EscapeRoomController.exe.config file in the application installation directory to point to this location, the location of the EscapeRoomGames.
